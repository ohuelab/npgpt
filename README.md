# NPGPT

This is the implementation of the paper "NPGPT: Natural Product-Like Compound Generation with GPT-based Chemical Language Models" by Koh Sakano, Kairi Furui, and Masahito Ohue.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `rye sync` (you need to install [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/)).

## Fine-tuned Models

Fine-tuned models trained on the [COCONUT](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net/) dataset are available. We provide two models fine-tuned from two different pre-trained models: [smiles-gpt](https://doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-5fwjd) and [ChemGPT](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-023-00740-3).

You can download the models from the following link:
